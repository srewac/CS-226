1.The project uses three maven libraries which I personally suggest you manually import from maven:
  #1 org.deeplearning4j:deeplearning4j-nlp:0.9.1
  #2 org.nd4j:nd4j-native-platform:0.9.1
  #3 org.json:json:20190722
  
2.The data file or folder should be put in /input/ directory.

3.Before you run the project, you should set the arguments for main(), args[0] is the twitter data directory and args[1] is the stopwords.txt directory
